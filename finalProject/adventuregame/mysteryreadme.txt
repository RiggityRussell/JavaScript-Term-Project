The purpose of the game and directions on playing the game: 
This is a text based mystery game!
There will be many choices and questions as you work through the game.
Once you have finished you will be naming the KILLER!
You may enter q at any time to quit the game.
You may enter x at any time to return to the Mansion Lobby
Sometimes there may be special hidden things if you try inputs that dont seem available.....

current problems or issues with the game - The secret passage doesn't lead anywhere yet, other than that I'm quite pleased with it.

plans to resolve the problems or issues - Add more to the overall game, make it EVEN BIGGER.

plans for future releases - Moving pictures at some point? Maybe an old school looking pixel graphics adaptaion.
