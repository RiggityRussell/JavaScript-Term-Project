This is a game very much like wordle!

The purpose of the game and directions on playing the game -- This is a game of word guessing skill! To play enter a letter in the closest open box, 
if it is correct and in the correct place it will be green! If it is correct but in the incorrect place it will be yellow! If it isn't in the word it will be gray.
There are no repeating letters in the words.

current problems or issues with the game - Biggest issue is if you enter a blank space it counts it as a correct letter in an incorrect spot.

plans to resolve the problems or issues - At some point I will need to update the blank space to be a gray box when entered.

plans for future releases - might try and release it as an app on another platform when I'm better at coding.
