Russell Run!

The purpose of the game and directions on playing the game - The purpose of this game is to last as long as possible without hitting my giant heads

current problems or issues with the game - hit boxes are slightly off at the moment. Which makes it difficult to play.

plans to resolve the problems or issues - I need to fix the hit boxes, and I want to add collision detection because I left the red balls from dodgeball in as well.

plans for future releases - I would like to add that when a ball hits a giant head that disappears, and all the other heads speed increases by .01.
